# My setup

I use [fish][2] as main shell; in fish I use [pyenv][3] and [virtualfish][4].

The following steps should find their equivalents in other shells too: if you
know how to create a virtualenv using a specific python version, you should be
able to replicate the result.

# How to make PlatformIO use a specific python version

0. Don't have vscode running and don't have the platformio extension installed.
1. Install latest python 3.8: 
```
    $ pyenv install 3.8.6
```
This might take a few minutes to compile; also might complain about missing
packages. ...and this is where it gets too platform specific.
2. Create a virtual environment for platformio/vscode:
```
    $ vf new -p 3.8 platformio
```
(I could not specify 3.8.6 but only 3.8; and virtualfish found 3.8.5 first.
Later I could `vf upgrade --rebuild --python 3.8` to get 3.8.6 ðŸ¤·)
3. Activate said virtual environment and start vscode:
```
    $ vf activate platformio
    $ code
```
(The binary is called `code` on my system.)
4. [Install the extension][5] in vscode.
